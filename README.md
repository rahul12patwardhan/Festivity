# Festivity

## Problem Statement

Management of a college fest can be an utter chaos with different teams and platforms to handle. 
There are a ton of problems that are currently faced in the organisation as well as execution of a college fest, which can be made much more efficient through a virtual platform connecting all the people involved, from the different tiers of organisational teams to anyone who visits the fest. 
There are a ton of platforms that are used either for communication among the fest organisational hierarchy or to assign tasks and track registrations. 
Same is true for any visitor entering a particular college fest, One is usually lost in the long queues for registration which often shy people off from participating in these particular events. 
Also, there is often a disconnect between a visitor and the organising team of a fest in terms of enquiry, important dynamic notifications or just for navigation around a new place. A visitor often is oblivious to the plethora of events happening there that he/she could enjoy, or even something impromptu like a flash mob happening in one corner of the fest. 
Hence, there is a major need for a dynamic medium for proper management of a college fest, connecting everyone involved.

## Solution

A virtual medium for an inter-hierarchical communication and management of files and tasks among the people involved in a college fest for the ease of management and accessibility of that particular fest i.e. an android application called Festivity.

## Contextual Inquiry and Inferences

* Most colleges have a different hierarchy with different number of people and power structure. Some have faculties whereas others not as much. The structure also needs to accommodate different events at same level and there position as compared to main Fest team.
* Maintaining inter team communication between registration, guest care, events and other teams is very important.
* Visitor registration and event registration data need to be put online and automated.
* Most of the issues during events rise due to lack of proper communication channels. It is important to ensure that panic button is not pressed and if anyone is free it is always known i.e. proper man management.
* As visitors it is always great to have a map and a guide. The people we talked to had trouble whenever the visited a new campus, in finding room and accommodation and food.

Review of the features:
  * Guest login - Mostly positive review as it will help maintain count and inventory of things that are free. Also help assign guide and make registration online.
  * Map - Another positive feature since almost every one we interviewed had trouble whenever they visited a new place.
  * Heat Map - A feature with mixed review as it raises privacy concern.
  * Hierarchy Map and chat room - Also positively reviewed since it will keep everyone involved in loop and also make contacting and maintaining info easy.
  * Live Event Status - Mixed review as it will make it easy for visitors to know about the events but will increase the workload of organisers.
  * FAQ system that will help both visitors and first-time volunteers to know about rules about the place and about different events.
